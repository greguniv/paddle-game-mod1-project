## Idea
The initial idea to execute the game was via divs - to avoid using 'canvas'. However, upon introduction to the videos by Chris Courses on YouTube, the div idea was scrapped for using the canvas, as a better understanding was given and it appeared a lot more streamlined. 

Player movement was successful, however the ball, the computer, and the scores were left unfinished due to time. Referencing the tutorials mentioned, it was a struggle to Frankenstein them together to achieve some form of workable code - the Player movement was a big challenge in trying to figure out parts missing and where to apply different strategies (c.clearRect) learned from different sources. Improvements to be made are to reconfigure the ball to move - the elements are there but it is not executing - something for a later time after more research and another watch of the videos for concepts to cement in my mind. Did I bite off more than I could chew for a first game attempt? Perhaps. But I certainly took a risk and did my best.
